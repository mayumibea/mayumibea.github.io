			<h2>Beatriz Mayumi is an illustrator currently living in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Her work is based on character creations, and the presence of environments that helps the imaginary to compose the storytelling feelings. She’s very fond of a mixture of watercolor and gouache textures, brush marks, and a solid color pallet that transmits emotions and the warmth of handmade aesthetics.</h2>

			<h2>Her clients include American Educator magazine, Red Ballon, and various Brazilian book publishers, such as FTD, Abril, Moderna, Somos Educação e SM Educação.</h2>
